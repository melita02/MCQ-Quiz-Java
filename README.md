MCQ Quiz Program allows the user to answer up to 10 Java programming basic questions. 
Then it displays a report that shows all the questions, their correct answers, the answers selected by the user and the total number of correct answers.

The program uses two two-dimensional arrays, one for storing pairs of question and its possible answers and another one for storing pairs of question and its correct answers. 
The answer selected by the user is added in the HashMap object for the report.

This program is implemented using Java AWT and Java Swing GUI.
